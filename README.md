# Web-Controlled-RC-Car
This project involves building a web-controlled RC car using a Raspberry Pi 4. The car can be controlled via a web interface, which allows for forward and backward motion, steering control, and live video streaming. The project is designed to provide a practical and fun way to explore robotics, embedded systems, and web development.
